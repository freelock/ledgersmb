RELEASE NOTES
LedgerSMB 1.4

Latest Revision:  1.4.0 beta 1, Dec 15, 2012

1:  Welcome to LedgerSMB

LedgerSMB is an accounting and ERP program initially aimed at small to midsize
businesses.  Currently the financials and supply chain management modules are
fairly complete, while other modules such as project management exist in a
rudamentary form.  The initial features are identical to SQL-Ledger 2.6.17 from
which it was derived, but the feature set is starting to diverge rapidly.

1.1 System Requirements:

* Perl 5.8.
* Apache, IIS, or other web server that supports CGI.
        * As of 1.3.24, FCGI is experimentally supported as is Plack-Starlet
* PostgreSQL 8.4 or higher.
* Any operating system that supports the above environment.
* The following CPAN modules:
	* Data::Dumper
	* Locale::Maketext
	* Locale::Maketext::Lexicon
	* MIME::Base64
	* Digest::MD5
	* HTML::Entities
	* DBI
	* DBD::Pg
	* Math::BigFloat
	* IO::File
	* Encode
	* Locale::Country
	* Locale::Language
	* Time::Local
	* Cwd
	* Config::General
	* MIME::Lite
        * TemplateToolkit
        * Moose
	

2:  What's New in 1.4?

2.1:  Framework Changes

New code in 1.4 now uses Moose to define classes.  Documentation is interlaced
in code and this allows for easier maintenance as well as better documentation.

1.4 also includes a new reporting framework which makes it relatively simple to
create reports from SQL queries which can then be displayed in HTML, PDF, and
CSV formats.

2.2:  New Features

LedgerSMB 1.4 now has a sophisticated and flexible business reporting dimensions
system replacing the older project and department accounting code.  This
approach allows a business to effectively tag line items of transactions with
various designations and then use these for running reports later including 
financial statements.  These dimensions are each hierarchical, allowing for
nesting of projects and departments for accounting and reporting purposes.

This can be used to do project and department accounting similar to the way
things worked in previous versions, but additionally these can be used to do
funds accounting and will be the basis of many new features in the future, from
CRM task lists to heavy manufacturing.

We have also integrated the template transaction addon, allowing for better
management of recurring transactions, as well as the budgets add-on.  The point
of sale has been broken off into addons to allow for faster release cycles.

2.4:  Database Changes

Projects and Departments have been replaced by the new reporting units
framework.  

3:  Known Issues

3.1:  Reposting Invoices

Reposting invoices is known to cause inaccuracies cost of goods sold and
inventory accounts.  This problem has been confirmed to affect SQL-Ledger 2.6.x 
as well and is caused by problems involving the de-allocation and trasaction
reversal routines.  It will be corrected (by removing the ability to truly
repost invoices) in an upcoming version as we continue to re-engineer the
application.

3.2:  Foreign exchange and payment reversals

The current design of foreign exchange handling means that if you reverse a
payment, the foreign exchange gains and losses will not be exactly reversed 
unless you are able to reverse on the same day.  If reversed on different days the 
gain/loss will be realized per the time when the payment was in effect and 
not reversed.

5:  Roadmap
This project has a losely defined roadmap and a set of statements and 
objectives contained in the documentation manager and trackers of sourceforge.
In general, our development is focused around the following principles:

* LSMB as infrastructure:  LSMB should be accessible from other applications.

* Universal applicability:  LSMB should be usable by any business and should
always do the right thing in the background.  Businesses should never find that 
they have outgrown the software.

* Focus on Small to Midsize Businesses:  LSMB's core market will remain in the
small to midsize market.

The above being said, we have a set of targets for the next major release 
(1.5.0).  There is no guarantee we will reach these targets but we have them
anyway.  These include:

* Rewritten Sales Orders 
* Rewritten journal entry and invoicing system for easier reporting.
* Heavy manufacturing support

6:  Get Involved
Contributors should start by joining the LedgerSMB users and devel lists.  Code
contributions at the moment must be committed by either project maintainer and
should be submitted either using the patches interface at Sourceforge or the
devel mailing lists.

Additionally, we can use help in QA, documentation, advocacy, and many other
places.
