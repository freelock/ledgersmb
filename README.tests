Test file number allocation:
00 - 09: General base checks
10 - 39: Module checks, no LSMB database required
     40: Set up test LSMB database
41 - 59: Operational checks, LSMB database required
60 - 88: Interface checks
     89: Clean up test LSMB database
90 - 99: Packaging checks

Environment variables can be used as flags to disable/enable tests >= 40

LSMB_TEST_DB must be set to a defined value if databases are going to be tested.

if LSMB_NEW_DB is set, test 40 (when it is complete) will create a database with
the name from this environment variable, and subsequent database tests will run
against that database.  If this is not set, and PGDATABASE is set, tests will 
run on that database. If neither are set, the tests will bail out.

Special notes on specific test cases:

42-dbobject.t:  Some tests will run even if LSMB_TEST_DB is not enabled.  These 
tests do not require a database connection.

43-dbtest.t:  This runs defined test cases from sql/modules/test/.  If new
scripts are added, they must be listed in this script as well.

62-api.t uses request hashes defined in t/data/62-request-data.  This
script employs a database commit filter to prevent commits to the db.  It is
safe to run on existing databases.

63-lwp.t will re-use the request hashes defined in test/data/62-request-data.
It does NOT employ a commit filter, so is NOT safe to run against production
data.  It will only run if the environment variable LSMB_TEST_LWN is set to true.
