LedgerSMB::DBObject::Report::Budget::Variance - Variance Report per Budget

=head1 SYNPOSIS

  my $report = LedgerSMB::DBObject::Report::Budget::Variance->new(%$request);
  $report->run;
  $report->render($request, $format);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic variance report for budgets.  A variance report shows budgetted
debits and credits along with those actually accrued during the stated period.
It thus provides a way of measuring both current and historical expenditures
against what was budgetted.
