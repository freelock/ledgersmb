=head1 METHODS

=over

=item get($args hashref)

Retrieves locations and returns them.  Args include:

=over 

=item entity_id (required)

=item credit_id (optional)

=item only_class int (optional)

=item

This function returns all locations attached to the entity_id and, if the credit_id is provided, all locations attached to the credit_id as well.  The two 
are appended together with the ones at the entity level coming first.

If only_class is set, all results will be discarded that are not a specific 
class (useful for retrieving billing info only).

=cut

    my ($self, $args) = @_;
