LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::User - User management Logic for LedgerSMB

=cut

package LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::User;
use Moose;
extends 'LedgerSMB::DBObject_Moose';

=head1 SYNOPSYS

Resetting a password (expires in 24 hrs):
  my $user = LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::User->get($entity_id);
  my $user->reset_password('temporary_password');

Creating a new user:
  my $user = LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::User->new(%$request); 
  $user->save;

Saving permissions:
  my $user = LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::User->new(%$request);
  $user->set_roles($request);

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over

=item entity_id

This is the integer id of the entity of the user

=cut 

has entity_id => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Int');

=item username

Username of the individual.  Would be the name of a valid Pg role.

=cut

has username => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');

=item pls_import

If this flag is set, we don't try to set a password on creating a new user. Also
we don't create the user account.  This assumes that we are making a
pre-existing PostgreSQL user into a LedgerSMB user.

=cut

has pls_import => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Bool');

=item password

This is only used for new users. It sets a temporary password (good for 24 hrs)

=cut

has password => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');

=item role_list

A list of role names granted to the user.

=cut

has role_list => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[ArrayRef[Str]]');
