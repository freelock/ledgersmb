  @bank_list = LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::Bank->list($entity_id);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides contact info handling for LedgerSMB.  Each contact info
record consists of optionally an entity_id or a credit_id, a class, a class
name, a description, and the actual contact information.  This is used to track
everything from phone numbers to email addresses both of natural persons and
companies in LedgerSMB.

head1 PROPERTIES

=over

=item entity_id Int

If set this is attached to an entity.  This can optionally be set to a contact
record attached to a credit account but is ignored in that case.

=cut

has 'entity_id' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Int]');

=item credit_id Int

If this is set, this is attached to an entity credit account.  If this and
entity_id are set, entity_id is ignored.

This is never set on retrieval, but is used to attach this as the default bank
account for a given entity credit account.

=cut

has 'credit_id' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Int]');

=item id

If set this indicates this has been saved to the db. 

=cut

has 'id' => (is =>'ro', isa => 'Maybe[Int]');

=item bic

Banking Institution Code, such as a SWIFT code or ABA routing number.  This can
be set to undef because there are cases where the BIC is not needed for wire
transfers.

=cut

has 'bic' => (is =>'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Str]');

=item iban

This is the bank account number.  It is required on all records.

=cut

has 'iban' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item list($entity_id)

Lists all bank accounts for entity_id.  This does not need to be performed on a
blessed reference.  All return results are objects.

=cut

sub list{
    my ($self, $entity_id) = @_;
    my @results = $self->call_procedure(procname =>
             'entity__list_bank_account', args => [$entity_id]);
    for my $row(@results){
        $self->prepare_dbhash($row); 
        $row = $self->new(%$row);
    }
    return @results;
}

=item save()

Saves the bank account object to the database and reinstantiates it, thus
setting things like the id field.

=cut

sub save {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my ($ref) = $self->exec_method({funcname => 'entity__save_bank_account'});
    $self->prepare_dbhash($ref);
    $self = $self->new(%$ref);
}

=item delete

Deletes the bank account object from the database.

=cut

sub delete {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my ($ref) = $self->exec_method({funcname => 'entity__save_bank_account'});
    return $ref;
}
