LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::Contact - Contact info handling for LSMB

=head1 SYNPOSIS

  @contact_list = LedgerSMB::DBObject::Entity::Contact->list(
         {entity_id = $entity_id, credit_id = $credit_id }
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides contact info handling for LedgerSMB.  Each contact info
record consists of optionally an entity_id or a credit_id, a class, a class
name, a description, and the actual contact information.  This is used to track
everything from phone numbers to email addresses both of natural persons and
companies in LedgerSMB.

head1 PROPERTIES

=over

=item entity_id Int

If set this is attached to an entity.  This can optionally be set to a contact
record attached to a credit account but is ignored in that case.

=cut

has 'entity_id' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Int]');

=item credit_id Int

If this is set, this is attached to an entity credit account.  If this and
entity_id are set, entity_id is ignored.

=cut

has 'credit_id' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Int]');

=item class_id Int

This must be set, and references the class id of the contact.  These can be
presumed to be static values, and are contained in the contact_class table.
Currently that table contains:

  id |      class      
 ----+-----------------
   1 | Primary Phone
   2 | Secondary Phone
   3 | Cell Phone
   4 | AIM
   5 | Yahoo
   6 | Gtalk
   7 | MSN
   8 | IRC
   9 | Fax
  10 | Generic Jabber
  11 | Home Phone
  12 | Email
  13 | CC
  14 | BCC
  15 | Billing Email
  16 | Billing CC
  17 | Billing BCC

has 'class_id' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

=item class Str

This is set when retrieving a contact record to the name of the contact class,
such as IRC, Fax, or Email.

=cut

has 'class' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Maybe[Str]');

=item description Str

This is set to the description of the contact record.

=cut

has 'description' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Str]');

=item contact Str

This is the string with the actual contact information, such as an email address
or phone number.

=cut

has 'contact' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');


=item old_class_id

If this is set, along with old_contact (below), then saving will try to overwrite
if possible.

=item old_contact 

=cut

has 'old_class_id' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Int]');

has 'old_contact' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Maybe[Str]');
