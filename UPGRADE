Upgrading to LedgerSMB 1.3

From LedgerSMB 1.3:

Untar over the top and then:

1)  Shell script process (UNIX/Linux only):

* cd to the sql/modules directory of the ledgersmb installation.
* sh reload_modules.sh [dbname] 
* repeat the shell script for each database for each database

2)  Automated process (all platforms):

* direct browser to the setup.pl file in the directory you are in.
* provide PostgreSQL superuser credentials and the name of your data base.
* Click continue.
* [Optionally] Click 'Backup DB' and/or 'Backup Roles'.
* Click 'Yes', answering "LedgerSMB 1.3 found. Rebuild/Upgrade?"
* Repeat for each database.

From LedgerSMB 1.1 and earlier:

For versions prior to 1.2, please upgrade to LedgerSMB 1.2 before upgrading to 
1.3.x.  To do this upgrade, simply untar the version of 1.2.x over your old
installation and run the relevant database upgrade scripts (in
sql/upgrade/legacy).  Then proceed below.

From LedgerSMB 1.2.x

* Untar over the top.
* Check your Perl dependencies:
   * perl Makefile.PL
   * make
   * make test
      But run 'make test' under an english locale, because some tests check for english error messages.
* run the install.sh script.
* direct your browser to the setup.pl script in your ledgersmb directory (via
  http) and follow the prompts:
   * Provide Pg superuser and database information for your existing database
   * Click continue when asked to upgrade
   * When asking for upgrade info:
       * contrib_dir is the directory where either tablefunc.control or 
         tablefunc.sql is, depending on your PostgreSQL version (9.1 and higher 
         would use tablefunc.control)
       * Default country is the country to map contacts which have no country 
         information to.
       * Default ar/ap accounts provide links to accounts for purposes of
         selection among multiple AR/AP accounts, and for purposes of payment
         reversals.  Enter account numbers here, like 1200 for AR and 2100 for
         AP
   * Provide user information.
   * log into the application and create additional users under System/User
     Management
